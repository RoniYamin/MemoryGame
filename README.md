# Memory Game

## Overview
This project is a classic "Memory Game" implemented as a client-side web application. The game involves matching pairs of cards, and it includes features for tracking time, responsive design, and user interaction.

## Features
- **Player Input**: At the beginning of the game, users can enter their name and select the number of card pairs (up to 30 pairs) they want to play with.
- **Game Start**: The game displays the player's name, a timer that counts the duration until the game is completed, and the game board with the specified number of card pairs.
- **Card Matching**: When the player finds matching card pairs, those pairs remain visible. The game continues until all pairs are matched.
- **Game End**: At the end of the game, the total time taken is displayed, and the player has the option to start a new game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts the number of cards per row based on the screen width. Larger screens display more cards per row, while smaller screens show fewer cards per row but with more rows.
- **Design**: The game features a reasonable design for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used
- 📝 **HTML**: Structure and content of the web pages.
- 🎨 **CSS**: Styling of the game, including responsive design.
- 💻 **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity.
- 📦 **Bootstrap**: Framework for responsive design and layout.
- ⚙️ **jQuery**: Simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.
